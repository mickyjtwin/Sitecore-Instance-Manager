These manifest files are used by SIM for proper treating .zip files in your local repository. They contain display name, sort order and custom installation scenario.

Please use these manifests as examples for creating your own ones. 

Please DO NOT create your own manifests here since they may be lost during next SIM update.

You are welcome to create them in the following folder instead:
%appdata%\sitecore\sitecore instance manager\manifests

There are five places where are manifest files are searched in:
- this Manifests folder
- Plugins folder
- %appdata%\sitecore\sitecore instance manager\manifests folder
- %appdata%\sitecore\sitecore instance manager\plugins folder
- folder where the .zip file is located
